# .gitignore

# Python automatically generates __pycache__ directories to store compiled bytecode files
# These bytecode files (.pyc, .pyo) speed up module loading and improve runtime performance
# They are environment-specific and may differ between Python versions or operating systems
# Committing __pycache__ directories provides no value and only pollutes git history
__pycache__/

# Ignore all compiled Python files to prevent accidental commits
# This includes standard bytecode patterns and internal Python cache artifacts
# Tracking these files in git can cause unnecessary diffs and cross-platform issues
*.py[cod]
*$py.class

# lib/data/ is used by the backend for temporary runtime files generated by SoniEffect
# This includes downloaded or uploaded video files, extracted audio files, converted media, and other temporary processing outputs
# All files in this directory are ephemeral, environment-specific, and may be deleted automatically
# Keeping this directory out of git prevents accidental commits of local or user data, reduces repository size, and avoids conflicts
lib/data/

# lib/data/audio/ stores temporary audio files generated during video-to-audio conversions
# Output audio files are created here and are intended to be short-lived
# Files in this directory are not user data and are managed by lib/services/data_cleaner.py
# Including audio files in git would significantly increase repository size and slow down cloning
# Audio is read dynamically from user sources, system media, or remote sources during runtime
lib/data/audio/

# Ignore common audio formats to prevent accidental commits
# These files are generated or downloaded dynamically and are not part of the source code
*.mp3
*.m4a
*.wav
*.flac
*.aac
*.ogg

# lib/data/video/ stores temporary input video files used for conversion
# Video files are large, binary, and short-lived, created when users upload or provide videos
# These files are read by the conversion pipeline, then cleaned automatically by lib/services/data_cleaner.py
# Including video files in git would make the repository heavy, slow, and prone to conflicts
lib/data/video/

# Ignore common video formats to prevent accidental commits
# These files are generated, downloaded, or converted at runtime
*.mp4
*.mov
*.avi
*.mkv
*.webm
*.flv

# This .gitignore ensures that no environment-specific files, temporary data, or generated media files are tracked in git
# It keeps the repository lightweight, clean, portable, and production-ready
# Developers can work without accidentally committing large or ephemeral assets
# Cleanup and lifecycle management of media files are handled entirely by lib/services/data_cleaner.py
